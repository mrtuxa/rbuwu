# RBuwu (Rust but in uwu) ðŸ¦€ðŸŒ¸

RBuwu is a rust extension that brings the adorable and charming uwu speak to the powerful and efficient Rust programming language. It provides a set of functions and syntax modifications to allow developers to write Rust code with a sprinkle of uwu cuteness.


# Example
```rust
use rbuwu::pwintwn;

fn main() {
    let hewwo = "Hewwo Wowwd";
    pwintwn!("{}", hewwo);
}
```
